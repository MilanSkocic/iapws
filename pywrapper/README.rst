 .. readme_inclusion_start

Python wrapper around the
`Fortran iapws library <https://milanskocic.github.io/iapws/iapws/index.html>`_.
Follow the `installation instructions <https://milanskocic.github.io/iapws/iapws/pages.html>`_.
for compiling and installing the library.

For now,the wrapper must be compiled on Linux, windows and MacOS platforms
after installing the iapws library using the compiler that was used to compile your python interpreter.

On Windows 
`Intel Fortran Redistributable <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/compilers-redistributable-libraries-by-version.html>`_ 
and 
`Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145>`_
are necessary.

The version of the python wrapper follows the versions (major and minor) of the iapws library.
The patches will be independent.
