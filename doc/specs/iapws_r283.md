# IAPWS R2-83

The technical report [R2-83](../references.html) defines constants used for computing the water properties.

## In water

$$ T_c = 647.096 K $$

$$ P_c = 22.064 MPa $$ 

$$ \rho _c = 322 kg/m^3 $$


## In heavywater

$$ T_c = 643.847 K $$

$$ P_c = 21.671 MPa $$
    
$$ \rho _c = 356 kg/m^3 $$
