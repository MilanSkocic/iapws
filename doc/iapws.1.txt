NAME
       iapws - Compute light and heavy water properties.

SYNOPSIS
       iapws SUBCOMMAND [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       iapws is a command line interface which computes the properties of light and heavy water according to IAPWS.

SUBCOMMANDS
       Valid subcommands are:

              +kh    Compute the Henry's constant for gases in H2O or D2O.  The default behavior is to compute the constant kH for O2 at 25°C.  See options.

              +kd    Compute the vapor-liquid distribution constant for gases in H2O or D2O.  The default behavior is to compute the constant kD for H2 at 25°C.  See options.

       Their syntax is:

              +kh    [OPTION...]

              +kd    [OPTION...]
