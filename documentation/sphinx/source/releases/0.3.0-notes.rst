iapws 0.3.0 Release Note
==================================

Summary
--------

* API break: functions for the Fortran code were renamed: 
   * They do not contain the package+module in the name for the sake of simplicity 
   * The package is only added in the functions for the C API in order to have a namespace-like behavior.
   * If needed for solving conflicts with other packages, the functions can be aliased.
* Remove separate sources files for the C API code for each module.
  Each module now contains the code for the C API.
* Implement tests with the test-drive framework.
* Add version extension in the pywrapper.
* Implement version module with its getter.
* Documentation update.
